to use docker volume following process we can follow

--> first we need to build the image 

--> then to use volume we have to specify -p option along with our project path and : destination while starting the container
--> cmd is given below

--> docker run --name my-container -p 4000:4000 --rm -v /home/shubham/Desktop/BackendPractice/DockerPractice:/app basic-app



The --rm option in the Docker run command specifies that the container should be automatically removed when it stops. 
This option is useful for containers that are meant to run a specific task and then exit, such as temporary or one-off jobs.
